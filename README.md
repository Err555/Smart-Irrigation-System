# Smart-Irrigation-System
The smart irrigation system is the system developed to optimize water use for agricultural crops, to improve the health of the soil together with the plant health by the use of multiple sensors. The system has a distributed wireless network of soil moisture and PH sensors placed into root zone of the plant. This smart systems are very productive especially in developed counties and most system uses big networks such as Internet.
The user will be able to communicate with the farm from anywhere with only simple messages. The GSM is integrated to the microcontroller to pass simple messages that are defined by the programmed instructions in the microcontroller. This module will be used for control and notification part of the system.
